Using Identity Resolution in Salesforce Data Cloud
Allows you to match and unify data across multiple records, creating a Single Customer Profile within your Data Space and Primary Data Model Object (DMO). Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up and leverage Identity Resolution:
________________________________________



Step 1: Understand Identity Resolution
What is Identity Resolution?
•	Identity Resolution reconciles records from different data sources by matching common identifiers (e.g., email, phone number) to unify customer profiles.
•	It works within a Data Space and applies to your chosen Primary Data Model Object (DMO) (e.g., Individual).
Key Components:
1.	Primary DMO: The main object for which identity resolution is performed (e.g., Individual for customer profiles).
2.	Rulesets: Define how records are matched and merged (e.g., by email or phone).
3.	Data Space: Ensures identity resolution is isolated to specific data partitions for governance and relevance.
________________________________________


Step 2: Configure Identity Resolution Rules

4.	Survivorship Rules:
o	Retain the most recent value for Last Login Date.
o	Prioritize verified email addresses.
5.	Unified Profile Output:
o	A single profile showing the customer’s name, email, purchase history, and engagement data.
6.	Next Steps:
o	Segment customers with high purchase frequency.
o	Trigger marketing campaigns for personalized product recommendations.
________________________________________
Conclusion
Using Identity Resolution in Data Cloud allows you to match and unify records into a comprehensive profile within a specific Data Space and Primary DMO. By defining robust matching and survivorship rules, you create accurate and actionable customer profiles that power insights, segmentation, and automation.
 
Rulesets in a identity Resolution (Data Cloud)
Rulesets in Salesforce Data Cloud are configurations used during Identity Resolution to define how records from different data sources are matched and unified. They specify how similarities or matches are identified between records using various matching methods, such as direct, fuzzy, or hierarchical matches.
Here’s an explanation of each type of ruleset:
________________________________________
1. Direct Match
Definition:
•	A Direct Match ruleset looks for exact matches between fields in different records.
•	This is the most precise and straightforward matching method.
Use Case:
•	Use when the field values are guaranteed to be consistent and standardized across data sources.
Example:
•	Match customer records where:
o	Email in Record A = Email in Record B.
o	CustomerID in Record A = CustomerID in Record B.
How It Works:
•	If the values in the specified fields are identical, the records are considered a match.
•	Example:
Record A: { Email: john.doe@example.com, CustomerID: 12345 }
Record B: { Email: john.doe@example.com, CustomerID: 12345 }
→ Match Found
________________________________________



2. Fuzzy Match
Definition:
•	A Fuzzy Match ruleset uses algorithms to find approximate matches between fields.
•	It allows for slight variations, such as typos, abbreviations, or inconsistent formatting.
Use Case:
•	Use when data might have inconsistencies, such as misspellings, capitalization differences, or partial data.
Example:
•	Match customer records where:
o	FirstName in Record A is similar to FirstName in Record B.
o	LastName in Record A is phonetically similar to LastName in Record B (using algorithms like Soundex).
How It Works:
•	Algorithms assess similarity based on thresholds (e.g., 80% similarity).
•	Example:
Record A: { FirstName: John, LastName: Smith }
Record B: { FirstName: Jon, LastName: Smyth }
→ Match Found (based on similarity threshold)
________________________________________
3. Hierarchical Match
Definition:
•	A Hierarchical Match ruleset combines multiple matching methods (direct, fuzzy, etc.) in a prioritized sequence.
•	If one method fails, it moves to the next in the hierarchy.
Use Case:
•	Use when some fields are more reliable than others for matching.

Example:
•	Match customer records in the following order:
1.	Direct Match on CustomerID.
2.	Fuzzy Match on FirstName and LastName.
3.	Direct Match on Email.
How It Works:
•	Records are matched based on the first successful rule in the hierarchy.
•	Example:
Record A: { CustomerID: 12345, FirstName: John, LastName: Smith, Email: john.smith@example.com }
Record B: { CustomerID: 12345, FirstName: Jon, LastName: Smyth, Email: john.smith@example.com }
→ Match Found (using CustomerID as the highest priority match rule)
________________________________________
4. Other Matching Types
•	Custom Match:
o	Combines multiple criteria using custom logic.
o	Example: Match customers where PhoneNumber matches AND Address is within the same zip code.
•	Threshold-Based Match:
o	Allows you to set a threshold for how closely records need to match to be considered a match.
o	Example: A similarity score of 85% or higher on names.
________________________________________
How Rulesets Work in Practice

o	Select which fields (e.g., Email, Phone, Name) to use for matching.
2.	Select the Matching Type:
o	Apply Direct, Fuzzy, or Hierarchical match methods.
3.	Set Thresholds:
o	For fuzzy matching, define the similarity score threshold for a match (e.g., 80%).
4.	Prioritize Matching Rules:
o	In a hierarchical setup, order the rules based on reliability (e.g., CustomerID > Email > Name).
5.	Test the Ruleset:
o	Run sample tests to validate how effectively the rules match records.
________________________________________
Example Scenario
Use Case:
You have customer records from multiple sources and need to unify them.
Source Data:
